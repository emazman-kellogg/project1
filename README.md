# project1

Website for Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management. For educational purposes only. 

Overview: This website is the beginning of an interactive resume. I've seen some before and think they are a great way to be a bit more creative (especially if you come from a dull background like finance), showcase some technical capabilities, and separate work experience into relevant themes. I'm looking forward to building this out more!
